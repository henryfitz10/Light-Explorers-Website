This project is a skeleton application to learn the basics of angular routing

To clone the application use the usual git clone command from a command tool

1/ git clone https://github.com/lillylangtree/routing.git

2/ the clone will create a routing folder in the current folder

the project shouldn't need a local server as all files are local to the
project

just navigate to the index file in a browser.
